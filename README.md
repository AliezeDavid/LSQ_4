# ðŸŒ€ Problem 4: Stack with Hybrid Items

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
Write a Java program to **create a stack with hybrid (mixed-type) items**.

## ðŸ§  What This Covers
- How Java stacks can store different object types
- Type handling with `Object` type in Java

## ðŸ“„ Explanation
This exercise highlights Javaâ€™s flexibility by storing different data types (String, Integer, Double, Boolean) in a single stack. Each step is explained so that the user understands how Java treats them as `Object`.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Concepts
- Object class
- Storing and printing hybrid data
- Type casting (if needed)
